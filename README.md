# Google Foobar

Foobar is a hidden coding challenge from Google consisting of 8 challenges over 5 levels of increasing difficulty. Users are invited to participate in the challenge when they search for certain programming terms on Google. I recieved an invite while researching dependency injection.

The problems in levels 1 and 2 are similar to interview questions. There is a substring problem, an array problem with many edge cases, and a sequence sum problem.

Level 3 is more involved. The solutions require dynamic programming and number theory.

Level 4 reformulates two problems in graph theory: maximum matching and maximum flow with multiple sources and multiple sinks. To solve these, I implemented the blossom algorithm and the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
